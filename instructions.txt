homeless-shelter

Background
You have been hired by a homeless shelter. They need a program to keep track of all the shelter's residents. The program should contain information about each person, and when they are checked in or out. No one is allowed to stay for longer than a week. If someone has checked out within the last 30 days, they cannot be checked in.

Purpose
This project is meant to introduce programmers to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) operations, as well as an introduction and review of all frameworks. This will allow programmers to connect the frontend to the backend of a program. This project will expound upon previously given understandings of Quasar, Feathers, Vue, and Vuex. It will also introduce Feathers Vuex. Among these frameworks, programmers will be taught about forms, routing, hooks, relationships, relateHooks, makeFindPaginateMixin, fastJoin, and more.
